	"notes": "Be sure to run sudo from an account that's in the Administrators group. Even though Windows will allow you to elevate to another account, if you do this the path environment variable will be different and things might not work like you'd expect.

If you'd like to always prompt for credentials (rather than just yes/no), this can be set through Windows policy settings."
